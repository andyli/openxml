### openxml
A Haxe implemention of Office Open XML.

Allows writing a .xlsx file at the moment.

This is a library I wrote for use in my work. So it will include only the features I need. In other words, do not expect the whole Open XML spec to be implemented. However, feel free to raise issues or feature requests and I will try to fix/add accordingly. Pull requests are highly appreciated.

### Usage
Check out the code samples in the "test" directory.
